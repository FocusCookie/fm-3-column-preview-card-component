### What I learned

In some cases words with hyphens will be break with a line break. In order to avoid this behavior your can use the asci/utf code &#8209; . This hyphen is a none breakable hyphen.

[No Line break after a hyphen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7691569/no-line-break-after-a-hyphen)
